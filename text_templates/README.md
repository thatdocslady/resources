Text Templates
==============

This folder contains various templates that you can use when you communicate via email or tweet about Django Girls.

Of course this list (or the content) isn't conclusive, or set in stone! It's meant to give you some basis in case you've never promoted an event online, or if you want to ease the workload a bit.

Feel free to fork, contribute with your own resources and pull request! <3
