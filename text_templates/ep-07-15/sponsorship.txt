Django Girls <city> Sponsorship

Body:

Hello <contact_name>!

My name is <your_full_name> and I am the organizer of Django Girls in <city>. Django Girls is a global, non-profit organization that helps women get involved with technology and teaches them about programming.

We're doing our <first/next> workshop in <city> on <date> and we would love to have you involved. We're looking for sponsors who can help us cover the costs of food, drinks, and other related expenses.

Attached is our sponsorship proposal, so you can get the general idea of the event. Of course, we would love to talk to you more about it, so feel free to get in touch!

Have a great day,
<your full name>
