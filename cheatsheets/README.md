Use the `render.py` script to transform the markdown cheatsheet to HTML and
PDF (you'll need to install the `requirements.txt` file):

    python render.py cheatsheet_html.md

This will generate `cheatsheet.html` and `cheatsheet.pdf`.
Feel free to change `template.html`, `logo.png`, or `stylesheet.css` to meet
your needs.
